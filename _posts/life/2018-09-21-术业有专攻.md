在网上看了那么多的大神（在某一方比自己牛逼的人），看了他们的做事风格，无不是条理清晰，写出来的文章排版读起来非常的美观。反观自己，做事邋里邋遢，致使自己一直处于迷茫之中。突然想到“老司机”一词，这词有贬义的意思，我猜测大概是来自云南一首民歌《老司机带带我》。相比于贬义，我更愿意用它褒义的一面，一名老司机应该是：①开车时间长，②心中有路，③注意力集中，想哪开到哪。学做老司机，做事有条理，术业专攻，想自己之所想，大胆去做事情。

译文（Translation）：

I read so many great gods on the Internet (the ones who are more powerful than themselves) and read their style of work. It is not clear and clear, and the layout of the articles written is very beautiful. On the other hand, doing things in the air, causing myself to remain confused. Suddenly I thought of the word "old driver". This word has a meaning of derogatory. I guess it is probably from a folk song in Yunnan, "The old driver brought me." Compared with Yiyi, I prefer to use its derogatory side. An old driver should be: 1 driving time is long, 2 is in the heart, 3 is focused, and where to go. Learn to be an old driver, do things well, specialize in the industry, think about what you want, and do things boldly.
