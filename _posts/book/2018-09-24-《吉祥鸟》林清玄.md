到加拿大温哥华，走出温哥华机场，看到机场的停车场有许多乌鸦，甚至停在车顶上，见到人也不怕生，鸦鸦地叫，绕在人的身边飞。 

来接飞机的朋友看我露出讶异的神情，笑着说：“加拿大的乌鸦最多了，加拿大人把乌鸦当成吉祥的鸟。”

“为什么呢？”

“因为乌鸦很聪明，很讨人喜欢，声音也很好听，又能维持生态的平衡，乌鸦也是极少数会反哺的鸟。”

我看着已经归化加拿大籍的朋友，真是难以想像，在他们的眼中乌鸦就好像我们眼中的喜鹊一样。

在中国人眼中是凶鸟的乌鸦，在加拿大人眼中却是吉祥鸟，可见这个世界上事物的价值是因人而异的，如果改变了我们的偏见，事物的价值就改变了。

就像我在加拿大的那些日子，几乎天天都看到乌鸦，愈看愈发现乌鸦很好看，声音也很好听，飞起来也很优美，一副吉祥的样子，好像穿黑礼服的绅士。

**对呀！那象征凶事的、不吉祥的是我们的心，与乌鸦有什么相干呢？**

译文（Translation）：

When I arrived in Vancouver, Canada, I walked out of Vancouver Airport and saw that there were many crows in the parking lot at the airport. I even stopped at the roof of the car. I saw people who were not afraid of being born, and crows and crowed around people.

The friend who came to pick up the plane looked at me with a surprised look and said with a smile: "Canada has the most crows, and Canadians regard crows as auspicious birds."

"why?"

"Because the crow is very clever, very flattering, sounds good, and maintains the ecological balance, the crow is also one of the few birds that will feed back."

It’s hard to imagine that I’ve looked at friends who have been naturalized in Canada. In their eyes, the crow is like the magpie in our eyes.

The crow of a fierce bird in the eyes of the Chinese is a lucky bird in the eyes of the Canadians. It can be seen that the value of things in this world varies from person to person. If we change our prejudice, the value of things changes.

Just like in my days in Canada, I saw crows almost every day. The more I saw the crows, the better, the sounds were also very good, and the flying was very beautiful. I looked like a gentleman in a black dress.

**Yes! What is the auspicious symbol of the murder is our heart, what does it have to do with the crow? **
