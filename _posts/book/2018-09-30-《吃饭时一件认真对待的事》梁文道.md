有一位日本大禅师，日日修行，也没什么别的嗜好，唯独喜欢甜食。在他病重的时候，弟子们从全国各地赶来探望，当然也不忘带一些果子送给恩师，好让他在圆寂前尝一尝。终于到了快要坐化的那一刻了，老禅师一如任何道行高深的修行者，端坐席上，相貌平和。然后，他竟然拿起了一块甜饼，放进口中，有点艰难地慢慢咀嚼。吃罢，他微微启唇，好像要说点什么，于是弟子们统统紧张地紧聚过去，心想师父要做他人生中最后一次开示了，非得好好听清楚不可。老禅师终于说话了，他只说了两个字：“好吃！”然后就断了气。

一个人走到了生命的最后一刻，心中想的竟然还是适才甜品的滋味，留下的遗言竟然还是对那块甜品的赞美，没有任何告别，更没有不舍与恐惧，他还不算最厉害的美食家吗？所谓的美食家难道不就该是这般模样吗？一心一意地对待眼前的食物，心无旁骛，甚至置生死于度外。

后来大家都说这位禅师真是高，已经达到觉悟的境界了，理由是佛学的修行最讲究一个人是否时刻“正念”。

“正念”指的就是非常专注地活在当下，走路时专心走路，睡觉时专心睡觉，不执着过往发生的快事，也不忧虑未来的烦恼。这种状态自然是快乐的，同时也是无我的，因为它完全切断了我的过去与未来，不把过去发生的事情当作自己的事，也不把将来的我看成是现在这个我的延续。要在平常达到这种状态已经很难，要在死的那一刹那仍然保持就更难。所以很多人都认定这位甜品禅师是真正地涅了。

其实我们天天进食，又何曾试过每一餐每一口都专心地吃呢？吃早餐的时候看报纸，吃午饭的时间变成一场工作会议，吃晚餐的时候用电视汁捞饭；我们有多久没试过好好地一心一意地对待眼前的食物了？如果我们专心地吃，食物的味道会不会变得和平常不一样呢？我们常常为一些吃斋的人感到可惜，为一些饮食上诸多禁忌的人扼腕。可是回头细想，我们平常囫囵吞枣地吃东西，难道这就真的享受了人生，懂得饮食的乐趣了吗？

看来美食家起码可以分成两类，绝大多数都是心思敏捷，想象力丰富，吃一块肉的时候，会回味起从前远方某家菜馆的手段是如何高明，抑或者明天的一顿盛宴。少数像甜品禅师这样的，则全神贯注于眼前所见嘴中所言。对这种人来讲，或许连一口白饭都是人间至味。

日本还有一位以烹调精进料理闻名的禅僧藤井宗哲，他曾经在一趟新干线的火车旅次上遇见一位青年，这个年轻的上班族把公文包放在膝上当小桌，一边喝啤酒一边看杂志，还拿了个便当出来吃。

宗哲和尚注意到，这位青年“是以看杂志为主，顺便吃便当”。他的行为“不过是把‘进食’当作机能性动作；也就是将食物放入口中，机械地咀嚼后，经过喉咙，最后储存在胃袋。宗哲和尚好整以暇地看着这位上班族，发现他的目光始终盯着杂志，一点也感觉不到便当的存在。这类人的饮食生活，可称之为‘机器人进食’”。

说来惭愧，我也是个进食机器人，常常一个人吃饭，而吃的时候也是丢不开书本杂志，生怕浪费了吃饭的时间。

真是讽刺，这可是个美食膨胀的年代，几乎人人都是美食家，偏偏我们还会觉得吃饭是件浪费时间的事情。大概心中有个标准，觉得日常三餐又是必要的营生手续，可以随便打发，任意填上其他活动；而美食，则是一种很特别的东西，必须认真对待。

美国佛学导师康菲尔德的葡萄干修行法，他教导学生用10分钟去吃一颗葡萄干，很多人吃完之后竟然觉得太饱了！

我们不可能每一顿饭都这么吃，但至少可以每天花一点时间练习心无旁骛地“正念”饮食。你也不用觉得它是个宗教色彩很浓的仪式，你只需要把它当成认识美食的基本练习就行了。

译文（Translation）：

There is a Japanese Zen master who practiced on a daily basis and has no other hobbies. He only likes sweets. When he was seriously ill, the disciples came to visit from all over the country, and of course did not forget to bring some fruit to the teacher, so that he could taste it before the silence. It was finally the moment when I was about to sit down. The old Zen master, like any high-level practitioner, sat on the table and looked calm. Then, he actually picked up a cookie and put it in the mouth. He chewed it a little hard. After eating, he slightly opened his lips, as if to say something, so the disciples all gathered tightly in the past, thinking that Master had to be the last time in his life, and had to listen clearly. The old Zen master finally spoke. He only said two words: "It's delicious!" Then he broke his breath.

When a person walks to the last moment of his life, he still thinks about the taste of a dessert. The last words left behind are still praises for that dessert. There is no farewell, no reluctance and fear. He is not the most powerful. Gourmet? Isn't the so-called foodie like this? Treating the food in front of one heart with one heart and one mind, and even leaving life and death.

Later, everyone said that the Zen master is really high and has reached the realm of enlightenment. The reason is that the practice of Buddhism is most concerned about whether a person is always "mindfulness".

"Mindfulness" refers to living in the moment with great concentration, walking attentively while walking, sleeping attentively while sleeping, not clinging to the past events, and worrying about future troubles. This state is naturally happy, and it is also selfless, because it completely cuts off my past and future, does not regard what happened in the past as my own, nor does it regard me in the future as my present. continue. It is very difficult to achieve this state in normal times, and it is even harder to keep it at the moment of death. So many people have decided that this dessert Zen master is truly Nirvana.

In fact, we eat every day, why have you tried every meal and eat it attentively? When I have breakfast, I read the newspaper, and the time for lunch becomes a work meeting. When I have dinner, I use TV juice to eat rice. How long have we tried to treat the food in front of our eyes with one heart and soul? If we concentrate on eating, will the taste of food become different from usual? We often feel a pity for some people who eat fast, and for some people who have many taboos on their diet. But when I look back, we usually eat and eat. Do you really enjoy life and know how to have fun?

It seems that foodies can be divided into two categories at least, most of them are agile and imaginative. When eating a piece of meat, they will recall how the method of a restaurant in the distance is so brilliant, or a feast of tomorrow. A few such as the Dessert Zen Master are concentrating on what they see in their eyes. For such people, perhaps even a white meal is human.

There is also a Zen 僧 宗宗 Zongzhe, who is famous for cooking and cooking. He once met a young man on a train trip on the Shinkansen. The young office worker put his briefcase on his lap and served as a beer. While reading the magazine, I also took a lunch and ate it.

Zong Zhe’s monk noticed that the young man “is mainly to read magazines and eat lunches by the way”. His behavior "is just to treat 'food' as a functional action; that is, put the food in the mouth, mechanically chew it, go through the throat, and finally store it in the stomach bag. Zongzhe and his wife looked at the office worker and looked at it. His eyes are always on the magazine, and he can't feel the existence of a bento. The eating habits of such people can be called 'robot eating'."

Speaking of it, I am also a eating robot. I often eat alone, and when I eat it, I can’t leave a book magazine, for fear of wasting my time.

It’s ironic, this is an era of food expansion, almost everyone is a foodie, but we still think that eating is a waste of time. There is a standard in my heart. I feel that daily meals are a necessary business procedure. I can just send it out and fill in other activities. Food is a very special thing that must be taken seriously.

American Buddhist tutor Confield's raisin practice, he taught students to eat a raisin in 10 minutes, many people feel too full after eating!

We can't eat every meal like this, but at least we can spend a little time every day practicing the "righteousness" diet. You don't need to think that it is a religious ritual. You just need to use it as a basic exercise to know food.
