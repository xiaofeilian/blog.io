赌场里没有常胜将军，人赌者总是输多贏少，连一个个赌王最终也死得惨惨。但无论这一高风险是如何明白无误，无论胜出概率在专家们反复计算之下是如何的微小，赌业自古以来还是长盛不衰。赌徒们从来不缺乏火热的激情、顽强的意志以及前仆后继的大无畏精神。原因很简单：他们的眼中多是成功，没有失败，总是把希望情不自禁地放大，诱导自己一次次携款前往。

在这里，赌业显现出一切骗局的首要前提，显示出一种人类普遍的心理顽症：自我机会高估。

自我机会高估不仅支撑赌业，也是诸多强权和罪恶的基础。“文革”那些年，人们虽然经济状况大体平等，政治上却有三六九等森严区分。奇怪的是，很长时间内多数人对这种地位分化非但不警觉，反而打心眼里高兴：革命的“依靠对象”觉得自己比“团结对象”优越，“团结对象”觉得自己比“争取对象”优越，“争取对象”觉得自己比“打击对象”要安全和体面——即便是一些灰溜溜的知识分子，也暗暗盘算着自己如何荣升“工农化”和“革命化”之列，相信灾难只会落在邻家的头上。机会非我莫属，倒霉自有他人，如此幻想使一批批潜在受害者同时成为伤害者，大家共同推动了政治倾轧，直到运动结束方大梦初醒，发现人人都窝着一肚子冤屈，没有几个贏家。

眼下，政治歧视渐少，人际之间的经济差距却在拉开，甚至出现了以掠夺国民财富为主要手段的腐败型暴富。有意思的是，很多人在怨恨腐败的同时，对腐败者的威风和奢华却不无羡慕，对滋养着腐败的拜金文化居然心神向往，对贫富过度分化甚至兴高采烈——尽管他们大多身处社会金字塔的中下层。他们无非是面对新一轮的时代博彩，照例高估自己的机会。不能骗得省长的批文，至少也可吃吃单位的公款吧？不能吃吃单位的公款，至少可以向学生家长要点红包吧？不能向学生家长要红包，至少还可用假文凭捞个职称吧？不能用假文凭捞职称，至少也可倒卖点假烟假酒吧？……很多人憧憬着自己的美事，算计着眼前的飞蝉，却不知黄雀在后，自己更有宰杀之虞。这一种由层层幻想叠加起来的普天同欢，使腐败逻辑开始合法化和公理化，蓄积日趋严重的社会危机。一旦破产和洪水到来，一旦崩市和骚乱出现，受害者肯定不仅仅是少数可怜虫。

**无望当上赢家之后，才可能怨恨赢家。不幸的是，赢家的规则就是全体赌徒曾经甘愿服从的规则。所有输家的“候补赢家”心态，最终支持了赢家的通吃；所有输家那里“别人遭殃”的预期，使自己最终被别人快意地剥夺。在这个意义上，自我机会高估意味着人们自寻绝路，意味着我们的敌人其实源于我们自己。**

制度易改而人性难移。正是受制于人性这一弱点，社会改造才总是特别困难：因为这样做的时候，改造者需要面对既得利益者（赢家）的反对，还经常面对潜在受害者（输家）的心理抵抗。历史上一个个危险的政治、经济、文化潮流，通常就是在赢家和输家身份不太分明的情况下，由大多数人共同协力推动而成——可惜很多历史描述都忽略了这一点。只有当失控的历史之轮一路疯狂旋转下去，离心力所致，才有越来越多的人被甩到局外的清醒中来。但到了那个时候，事情就有些晚了。即便历史流向还可以向合理的方位调整，即便人们又一次学了抗议、揭发、反思、抹鼻涕、比伤疤、高论盈庭、大彻大悟，但苦酒已经酿就，过去的代价已不可追回。有什么办法呢？

人民是真正的英雄吗？是的，但这里是指觉悟了的人民。从人民的未觉悟到已觉悟，往往有漫长时光，有一个受害面逐渐扩大的过程。在这种变化到来之前，人民——至少是人民中的多数——也常常充当自掘陷阱的帮凶，使有识之士非常为难。因为能够“学而知之”（孔子语）的毕竟不多，“困而知之”（孔子语）的才是多数。正因为如此，忠告的效果往往有限，忠告无法代替聆听者的切肤之痛，常常要倚重于忠告者最不愿意发生的灾难，才能激发出人民的觉悟和行动。

请注意：这些灾难，这些反复上演的历史悲剧，总是在人们得意洋洋自我机会高估的时候悄悄逼近。

译文（Translation）：

There are no regular winners in the casino. The gamblers always lose more and more, and even the gambling kings will eventually die. But no matter how high the risk is, no matter how small the winning probability is under the repeated calculations of experts, the gambling industry has been prosperous since ancient times. The gamblers never lacked the passion of passion, the tenacious will, and the fearless spirit of the former servants. The reason is simple: their eyes are mostly successful, there is no failure, they always magnify their hopes and induce themselves to bring money with them.

Here, the gambling industry shows the primary premise of all scams, showing a common psychological chronic illness: self-risk overestimation.

Overestimation of self-energy not only supports gambling, but also the foundation of many powers and sins. In the "Cultural Revolution" years, although people's economic conditions were generally equal, there were three or six political differences in politics. The strange thing is that for a long time, most people are not alert to this status differentiation, but they are happy in their hearts: the revolutionary "depending on the object" feels that they are superior to the "unit of solidarity", and the "unit of solidarity" feels that they are better than "Superior, "seeking the object" feels that it is safer and more decent than the "target" - even some slick intellectuals are secretly calculating how they have risen to the ranks of "worker-agriculture" and "revolutionization". The disaster will only fall on the head of the neighboring family. Opportunity is none other than me. I am unlucky to have other people. I am so illusory that a group of potential victims have become hurters at the same time. Everyone has promoted political swaying until the end of the campaign. When the dream is over, everyone finds that they are suffering from a stomach. There are not a few winners.

At the moment, political discrimination is gradually decreasing, and the economic gap between people is opening up. There is even a corruption-type rich man who plunders national wealth as the main means. Interestingly, many people are resentful of corruption, but they are not envious of the prestige and luxury of corrupt people. They are eager for the culture of nourishing corruption, and they are overly divided and even euphoric for the rich and the poor – even though they are mostly in society. The middle and lower layers of the pyramid. They are nothing more than facing a new round of gambling, as usual, overestimating their chances. Can't deceive the approval of the governor, at least eat the public funds of the unit? Can't eat the public funds of the unit, at least you can give the parents a red envelope? Can't ask a student's parents for a red envelope, at least a fake diploma can be used to get a job title? Can't use a fake diploma to get a job title, at least you can also sell fake fake cigarettes? ... Many people are taking advantage of their own beautiful things, and they are counting on the flying locusts in front of them, but they don’t know that the oriole is behind, and they are even more slaughtered. This kind of commonplace, which is superimposed by layers of fantasy, makes the logic of corruption begin to be legalized and axiomized, accumulating increasingly serious social crises. Once bankruptcy and floods come, once a city collapses and riots occur, the victims are certainly not just a few poor worms.

**Unable to be the winner, you can hate the winner. Unfortunately, the winner's rule is the rule that all gamblers have been willing to obey. All the losers' "waiting winners" mentality finally supported the winner's all-out; all the losers' expectations of "others suffer" made them ultimately deliberately deprived. In this sense, overestimation of self-interest means that people are looking for a way out, meaning that our enemies actually originate from ourselves. **

The system is easy to change and humanity is difficult to move. It is precisely because of this weakness of human nature that social transformation is always particularly difficult: because when doing so, the reformers need to face the opposition of the vested interests (winners) and often face the psychological resistance of potential victims (losers). Historically, dangerous political, economic, and cultural trends are often driven by the majority of people in situations where the winners and losers are not well-identified—unfortunately, many historical descriptions ignore this. Only when the out-of-control historical wheel swayed wildly and caused by centrifugal force, more and more people were caught in the waking of the outside. But by that time, things were a bit late. Even if the historical flow can be adjusted to a reasonable direction, even if people once again learned to protest, expose, reflect, wipe the nose, than the scars, high on the court, and Dachao, but the bitter wine has been brewed, the past price can not be recovered. . what else can we do?

Are the people really heroes? Yes, but here is the people who have realized. From the unconsciousness of the people to the realization of the consciousness, there is often a long time, and there is a process of gradually expanding the victim's face. Before this change came, the people—at least the majority of the people—also often acted as accomplices in self-excavation traps, making it very difficult for people of insight. Because there are not many "learning and knowing" (Confucius), the "sleepy and knowing" (Confucius) is the majority. Because of this, the effect of advice is often limited. Advice cannot replace the pain of the listener. It often relies on the most unwilling disaster of the admoniser to inspire the people's awareness and actions.

Please note: These disasters, these repeated historical tragedies, are always approaching when people are over-expected.
