**我们中国人是最怕旅行的一个民族。闹饥荒的时候都不肯轻易逃荒，宁愿在家乡吃青草啃树皮吞观音土，生怕离乡背井之后，在旅行中流为饿莩，失掉最后的权益——寿终正寝。**

至于席丰履厚的人更不愿轻举妄动，墙上挂一张图画，看看就可以当“卧游”，所谓“一动不如一静”。说穿了“太阳下没有新鲜事物”。号称山川形胜，还不是几堆石头一汪子水？

我记得做小学生的时候，郊外踏青，是一桩心跳的事，多早就筹备，起个大早，排成队伍，擎着校旗，鼓乐前导，事后下星期还得作一篇《远足记》，才算功德圆满。旅行一次是如此的庄严！我的外祖母，一生住在杭州城内，八十多岁，没有逛过一次西湖，最后总算去了一次，但是自己不能行走，抬到了西湖，就没有再回来——葬在湖边山上。

古人云，“一生能着几雨屐？”这是劝人及时行乐，莫怕多费几双鞋。但是旅行果然是一桩乐事吗？其中是否含着有多少苦恼的成分呢？

出门要带行李，那一个几十斤重的五花大绑的铺盖卷儿便是旅行者的第一道难关。要捆得紧，要捆得俏，要四四方方，要见棱见角，与稀松露馅的大包袱要迥异其趣，这已经就不是一个手无缚鸡之力的人所能胜任的了。关卡上偏有好奇人要打开看看，看完之后便很难得再复原。“乘兴而来，兴尽而返。”很多人在打完铺盖卷儿之后就觉得游兴已尽了。在某些国度里，旅行是不需要携带铺盖的，好像凡是有床的地方就有被褥，有被褥的地方就有随时洗换的被单，——旅客可以无牵无挂，不必像蜗牛似的顶着安身的家伙走路。携带铺盖究竟还容易办得到，但是没听说过带着床旅行的，天下的床很少没有臭虫设备的。我很怀疑一个人于整夜输血之后，第二天还有多少精神游山逛水。我有一个朋友发明了一种服装，按着他的头躯四肢的尺寸做了一件天衣无缝的睡衣，人钻在睡衣里面，只留眼前两个窟窿，和外界完全隔绝，——只是那样子有些像是KKK，夜晚出来曾经几乎吓死一个人！

原始的交通工具，并不足为旅客之苦。我觉得“滑竿”“架子车”都比飞机有趣。“御风而行，冷然善也，”那是神仙生涯。在尘世旅行，还是以脚能着地为原则。我们要看朵朵的白云，但并不想在云隙里钻出钻进；我们要“横看成岭侧成峰，远近高低各不同，”但并不想把世界缩小成假山石一般玩物似的来欣赏。我惋惜米尔顿所称述的中土有“挂帆之车”

尚不曾坐过。交通工具之原始不是病，病在于舟车之不易得，车夫舟子之不易缠，“衣帽自看”固不待言，还要提防青纱帐起。刘伶“死便埋我”，也不是准备横死。

旅行虽然夹杂着苦恼，究竟有很大的乐趣在。旅行是一种逃避，——逃避人间的丑恶。

“大隐藏人海，”我们不是大隐，在人海里藏不住。岂但人海里安不得身？在家园也不容易遁迹。成年的圈在四合房里，不必仰屋就要兴叹；成年的看着家里的那一张脸，不必牛衣也要对泣。家里面所能看见的那一块青天，只有那么一大块。取之不尽用之不竭的清风明月，在家里都不能充分享用，要放风筝需要举着竹竿爬上房脊，要看日升月落需要左右邻居没有遮拦。走在街上，熙熙攘攘，磕头碰脑的不是人面兽，就是可怜虫。在这种情形之下，我们虽无勇气披发入山，至少为什么不带着一把牙刷捆起铺盖出去旅行几天呢？在旅行中，少不了风吹雨打，然后倦飞知还，觉得“在家千日好，出门一时难”，这样便可以把那不可容忍的家变成为暂时可以容忍的了。下次忍耐不住的时候，再出去旅行一次。如此的折腾几回，这一生也就差不多了。

旅行中没有不感觉枯寂的，枯寂也是一种趣味。哈兹利特Hazlitt主张在旅行时不要伴侣，因为：“如果你说路那边的一片豆田有股香味，你的伴侣也许闻不见。如果你指着远处的一件东西，你的伴侣也许是近视的，还得戴上眼镜看。”一个不合意的伴侣，当然是累赘。但是人是个奇怪的动物，人太多了嫌闹，没人陪着嫌闷。耳边嘈杂怕吵，整天咕嘟着嘴又怕口臭。旅行是享受清福的时候，但是也还想拉上个伴。只有神仙和野兽才受得住孤独。

在社会里我们觉得面目可憎语言无味的人居多，避之唯恐或晚，在大自然里又觉得人与人之间是亲切的。到美国落矶山上旅行过的人告诉我，在山上若是遇见另一个旅客，不分男女老幼，一律脱帽招呼，寒暄一两句。还是很有意味的一个习惯。大概只有在旷野里我们才容易感觉到人与人是属于一门一类的动物，平常我们太注意人与人的差别了。

真正理想的伴侣是不易得的，客厅里的好朋友不见得即是旅行的好伴侣，理想的伴侣须具备许多条件，不能太脏，如嵇叔夜“头面常一月十五日不洗，不太闷痒不能沐”，也不能有洁癖，什么东西都要用火酒揩，不能如泥塑木雕，如死鱼之不张嘴，也不能终日喋喋不休，整夜鼾声不已，不能油头滑脑，也不能蠢头呆脑，要有说有笑，有动有静，静时能一声不响的陪着你看行云，听夜雨，动时能在草地上打滚像一条活鱼！这样的伴侣哪里去找？

译文（Translation）：

We Chinese are the most afraid of traveling. When I was famine, I wouldn’t easily escape. I would rather eat grass and sap in my hometown and swallow the sound soil. I was afraid that after I left my hometown, I would be hungry during my travels and lose my last right. 

As for the people who are full of Xifeng, they are even more reluctant to act rashly. If you look at a picture on the wall, you can use it as a "sleeping tour". The so-called "moving is better than a quiet." To put it bluntly, "there is nothing new under the sun." Known as the mountains and rivers, isn’t it a few piles of stones?

I remember when I was a primary school student, I was a heartbeat in the countryside. I had to prepare for it early, start early, line up in a team, hold the school banner, and lead the drums. I will have a "Hiking" next week. Only counted merits. Traveling once is so solemn! My grandmother, who lived in Hangzhou for the rest of her life, was in her 80s. She didn't visit the West Lake once. She finally went there once, but she couldn't walk. She went to the West Lake and didn't come back again—buried on the lakeside.

The ancients said, "How many rains can you have in your life?" This is to persuade people to be happy in time. But is travel really a pleasure? Does it contain some distressing ingredients?

When you go out to bring your luggage, it is the first difficulty for travelers to lay a roll of tens of kilograms of heavy flowers. If you want to tie it tightly, you have to be tied up, you have to be square, you have to see the horns, and the big bag of the thin truffle stuffing is very different. This is not the ability of a person with no hands. It is. There are curious people on the level to open the look, it is very difficult to recover after reading. "Come on, come back." Many people feel that they have finished their play after they have finished the cover. In some countries, travel does not need to be carried, as if there is a place where there is a bed, there is a bedding, and there is a place to be washed at any time, the passengers can be unattached, not like a snail. Walk with the guy who is seated. It is easy to carry the cover, but I have never heard of traveling with a bed. The beds in the world are rarely free of bed bugs. I doubt that after a blood transfusion overnight, how many spirits will swim in the mountains the next day. I have a friend who invented a costume and made a seamless pajamas according to the size of his body and limbs. The man was in the pajamas, leaving only the two holes in front of him, completely isolated from the outside world. Some are like KKK, and when I came out at night I was almost scared to death!

The original means of transportation is not enough for the passengers. I think the "slippery" "shelf car" is more interesting than the plane. "The wind is good, the cold is good," that is the life of the gods. Traveling in the world is still based on the principle that the feet can touch the ground. We have to look at the blossoming white clouds, but we don't want to drill in the clouds; we have to "cross the horizon into the peaks of the mountains, the distances are different," but I don't want to shrink the world into a rockery. Come and enjoy. I deplore Milton’s claim that there is a “sail car” in Middle-earth.

Haven't been there yet. The originality of the means of transportation is not a disease. The disease is that it is not easy to get a boat. The boatman’s boat is not easy to get around. The “clothing cap is self-seeing” is not to be said, but it is also necessary to guard against the green yarn. Liu Wei’s “death will bury me” is not prepared to die.

Although the travel is mixed with distress, there is a lot of fun. Travel is an escape, escaping the ugliness of the world.

"The big hidden sea," we are not big hidden, can't hide in the sea. But what about people in the sea? It is not easy to trace in the home. The adult circle is in the quadruple room, you don't have to sigh in the back of the house; the adult look at the face of the house, you don't have to worry about the cow clothes. The piece of green sky that can be seen in the house is only a big piece. Inexhaustible breeze and bright moon can not be fully enjoyed at home. To fly a kite, you need to hold a bamboo pole to climb the ridge. It depends on the neighbors and the neighbors. Walking on the street, bustling, slap in the face is not a human face beast, is a poor worm. Under such circumstances, although we have no courage to put it into the mountains, at least why not take a toothbrush and wrap it up and travel for a few days? In the travel, there is no shortage of wind and rain, and then tired and fly to know, "I feel good at home, it is difficult to go out at a time", so that the intolerable home can be turned into temporary tolerance. When you can't stand it next time, go out and travel again. This kind of toss a few times, this life is almost the same.

There is no feeling of silence in the journey, and silence is also a kind of fun. Hazlitt advocates not to be a partner when traveling, because: "If you say that a piece of bean field on the road has a scent, your partner may not smell. If you point to something in the distance, your partner may It is myopia, and you have to wear glasses to look at it." An uncomfortable partner is of course cumbersome. But people are a strange animal, too many people are too noisy, no one is accompanied by boring. The ears are noisy and noisy, and all day, screaming and afraid of bad breath. Travel is the time to enjoy the blessing, but also want to pull a companion. Only the gods and the beasts can stand alone.

In the society, we feel that there are many people who are ignorant of language and tasteless, avoiding fear or lateness, and in nature, they feel that people are intimate. People who traveled to the Rocky Mountains of the United States told me that if they met another passenger on the mountain, regardless of men, women and children, they would all take off their hats and greet them with one or two sentences. Still a very habit. It is only in the wilderness that we can easily feel that human beings belong to one kind of animal. Usually we pay too much attention to the difference between people.

A truly ideal companion is not easy to get. A good friend in the living room is not necessarily a good companion for travel. The ideal companion must have many conditions, not too dirty, such as the uncle, "The head is often not washed on January 15th. It’s not too itchy, you can’t have it, you can’t have cleansing, you have to use fire wine for anything, you can’t make wood carving like mud, if you don’t open your mouth, you can’t stop talking all day long, you can’t stop all night, you can’t get your head slippery, You can't be stupid, you have to talk and laugh, you have to be quiet, you can watch the clouds when you are still silent, listen to the night rain, and you can roll like a live fish on the grass! Where is this partner looking for?
