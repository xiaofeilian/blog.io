宋朝的司马光是国家的大臣，很多人刚进朝廷的时候总是先去拜访他。

他跟对方聊天的时候常常问一个使人很难堪的问题。他问：你家里有没有钱？你的开支够不够？你有没有欠人家的钱？诸如此类。被问的人出来以后都很奇怪，说司马光这么了不起的国家大臣，怎么问我有没有钱这种小问题啊，怎么会问这种怪问题后来大家再打听，才知道是什么原因。

司马光的标准是：你这个人有没有钱，能不能维持生活，能不能不为五斗米折腰。你有这个本领有这个钱以后，他才认为你有独立的人格。

随时可以丢掉乌纱帽，为了我的原则可以不做官。为什么呢？因为我不会饿死，我有钱可以保护我的自由。所以，有没有钱才可以决定一个人有没有独来独往的人格。这就是司马光的一个标准。

美国的富兰克林讲过一句话，他说，两个口袋空的人腰挺不直。为什么呢？因为你会求人。你说我不求人，我就是说不出，我愿意。好，你小孩得了盲肠炎要开刀，要救命，你没有钱，你要不要为你的小孩去求别人？你会求人。 为了自己可以做好汉，可是为了救小孩你会求人。

美国的总统里，有两个总统不领薪水，为什么？老子有钱，老子愿意完全义务地为国家服务。一个就是胡佛，一个就是肯尼迪。胡佛的太太会讲中文。1900年，胡佛和他太太在中国开滦煤矿做工程师。他那时候就发了大财，在中国赚了100万美金。他讲了一句话：人生最难赚的就是第一个100万。

我过去开的汽车后面的窗是三角形的，在台湾只有两辆有这种三角窗的凯迪拉克汽车，这是当年我跟电影明星太太胡茵梦坐的汽车。现在没有汽车了，我李敖有时坐公共汽车。上车的时候汽车司机认识我，李大师，你怎么也坐公共汽车？我说，我为什么不能坐公共汽车？

这是我的平民化，所以我们不在乎这个，有就有，没有就没有，我讲这些，证明了一点：我们要有一个生活的物质基础。我就是想告诉大家，**要有点钱来保护自己的独来独往，保护你随时可以跟老板说再见，随时不为五斗米折腰。你要有一点点钱，把这钱藏起来，保护你的自由。**

要在这个基础之上，你才能够说，我一辈子的志愿不是吃饱了穿暖了就算了，我还有更高的更伟大的志愿呢。

译文（Translation）：

Sima Guang of the Song Dynasty was the minister of the country. Many people always visited him when they first entered the court.

When he chats with each other, he often asks a question that is embarrassing. He asked: Is there money in your family? Is your spending enough? Do you have any money owed to others? And so on. After being asked, the people who were asked were very strange. They said that Sima Guang’s great country minister, how to ask me if I have any small problems with money, how can I ask this strange question and then I will ask you again to find out why.

Sima Guang’s standard is: Do you have money for this person, can you maintain your life, can you not fold for the five buckets of rice? After you have this skill with this money, he thinks you have an independent personality.

You can throw away the black hat at any time, and you can't be an official for my principles. why? Because I don't starve, I have money to protect my freedom. Therefore, whether there is money or not can determine whether a person has a unique personality. This is a standard for Sima Guang.

Franklin of the United States said a word, he said that the two empty pockets are not straight. why? Because you will ask for help. You said that I don't ask for help, I just can't say it, I am willing. Well, your child has a cure for appendicitis, to save lives, you have no money, do you want to ask someone for your child? You will ask for help. In order to be a good man, you will ask for help in order to save the child.

In the president of the United States, two presidents do not receive a salary. Why? Laozi has money, and Laozi is willing to serve the country with full obligation. One is Hoover and the other is Kennedy. Hoover’s wife speaks Chinese. In 1900, Hoover and his wife worked as engineers in Kailuan Coal Mine in China. He made a fortune at that time and earned $1 million in China. He said one sentence: the hardest thing to earn in life is the first one million.

The window behind the car I used to drive was triangular. There were only two Cadillac cars in Taiwan with this triangular window. This was the car I used to sit with the movie star wife Hu Yinmeng. There is no car now, and I am a bus sometimes. When I got on the bus, the car driver knew me, Master Li, how do you take the bus? I said, why can't I take the bus?

This is my civilianization, so we don't care about this. If there is one, there is no. I said this and proved one point: we must have a material basis for life. I just want to tell you, ** want a little money to protect your loner, protect you at any time to say goodbye to the boss, at any time not for the five buckets of rice. You have to have a little money, hide this money and protect your freedom. **

On this basis, you can say that my lifelong volunteers are not full of food and warmth, and I have higher and greater volunteers.
