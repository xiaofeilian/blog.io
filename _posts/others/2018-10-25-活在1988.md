**赵已然**出生于1963年1月23日，宁夏回族自治区，中卫市（原中卫县）。
他的歌声，无论翻唱还是创作，都带有浓重的布鲁斯和西北民歌风格。在这方面，迄今为止，尚未有过任何华语歌手达到过他的境界。他的演唱和吉他技巧同样民间、随意而又堪称精湛，带有浓烈的沧桑情怀。赵已然的80年代老歌不但把他自己的青春变成一场无可挽回的旧梦，也足以凝聚更多人的悲欢离合，将苦酒和热泪融化成叹息。
他的父亲是一位作曲家，右派，后来做了小学老师，母亲是秦腔演员。他从小学三、四年级就开始演出——唱歌、跳舞。11岁学习二胡，很快就随着毛泽东思想宣传队巡回演出。1980年他考上了陕西师范大学化学系，在学校乐队，自学学会了打鼓，开始在学校内外演出、赚外快。毕业以后他没有去作化学老师，也没有从事任何和知识、体制有关的事情，走穴、伴奏。1989年，他来到北京，那时候，他弟弟赵牧阳已经是北京摇滚圈的名人
人称“西北鼓王”。此后他进入地下音乐世界，以鼓手为业，也在南方的夜总会伴奏挣钱。后来他遭遇重大的人生坎坷，颠沛流离，逐渐走向没落，也不再提起那一段经历。
老大说，除了毕业后短暂上过几天班，他没有从音乐之外的地方挣过一分钱。但1998年以后，近10年的时间里，他也没有靠音乐挣到过钱。他生活在地下音乐圈里，靠借钱和亲友接济为生。“后来，我慢慢变成了一个人。只有一双拖鞋、一只牙刷，住在了农村，且越搬越远。”那是2000年前后，一群人和他一起生活在北京东边的农村。几年的时间里，宁夏人、山东人，外地的摇滚乐手在那里出没，说起来，那地方就叫“院子”，像一个公社，或者破落的家庭。大家都叫他老大，因为他家中兄弟姐妹4人，他排行老大。但也是因为他年龄最大，资历最老，穷但是骄傲，有贵族的气派。那时候，他是无数住在北京周边农村的外地乐手之一，大家都不上班，也没有人需要他们的音乐。
2002年他在三里屯酒吧街南街，野孩子乐队的主唱开了“河”酒吧，那是北京民谣音乐的中心。老大的朋友圈，是年轻的地下摇滚乐手，也短暂地在“木推瓜”等乐队呆过；他的同代人，都过上了稳定的生活，已经不在同一个圈子。演出结束了，酒吧只剩下一帮朋友，老大就抱起吉他，唱他唱过的歌。大家被他唱呆了，有人就哭了。都是1980年代的流行歌，内容相当单纯，是关于爱情、青春的歌咏和充满人情味的故事。老大的吉他也简单，有布鲁斯的味道，有西北民歌的味道，但就像他按着琴弦的手指一样，又灵活又粗糙。他唱的不是那些歌，而是他的生命。所有的苦，所有的美好回忆，他的穷困和悲哀，他的自由的灵魂。

**音乐作品**：

02.我就逍遥自在
03.北京的金山上
04.偶然啊还是奇遇

**专辑自白**：
我本该是一名化学教师，阴差阳错，不幸做了鼓手。十多年来，不求上进，碌碌无为，混迹于狭小的地下音乐王国，沉迷于越来越糊涂越来越荒唐的卡通境地，信以为真地在有限的几位朋友面前义正辞严、斩钉截铁地鼓吹着“垮到极处”的寄生虫哲学。从没有过工作，后以借钱为生。
后来，我慢慢变成了一个人。只有一双拖鞋、一只牙刷，住在了农村，且越搬越远。
再后来，我笑得有些难看了，因为我越来越没钱。以至于常常被迫求告家人，艰难度日。
有一天，我终于发现，磕不动了，再也垮不下去了。我头天让酒喝醉，吐了；第二天一早，酒还没醒，咣叽，又让茶给喝吐了。
那一天，我发现，我的脸特别难看，太难看了。我终于知道，我太不漂亮了。
我一生热爱漂亮女人，痴情于不敢面对、不敢亵渎的漂亮女人，然而我自己却从没漂亮过，从没漂亮过一次。
我也知道了，在我所追求的自由中，我没有自由过一次。
于是，我终于倒下了。
于是，在深夜里，在不要钱的灿烂阳光下，在只有神或鬼才能看得见的微笑或悲痛中，我想起了那些曾经会唱的歌。
于是今天，被逼无奈，我端正了思想，换了身份，不做鼓手，稍不情愿地自觉有些滑稽般地坐在了这里，怀着年轻时代的美好梦想，准备唱歌。

译文（Translation）：

** Zhao has been born on January 23, 1963, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Zhongwei City (formerly Zhongwei County).
His singing, whether it is cover or creation, has a strong style of blues and northwest folk songs. In this regard, so far, no Chinese singer has reached his realm. His singing and guitar skills are equally folk, casual and exquisite, with strong vicissitudes. Zhao’s 80s old songs not only turned his own youth into an irretrievable old dream, but also condensed the joys and sorrows of more people, melting bitter wine and tears into sighs.
His father was a composer, rightist, and later a primary school teacher, and his mother was a Qin actor. He started performing in the third and fourth grades of elementary school - singing and dancing. At the age of 11, he studied erhu and soon toured with the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. In 1980, he was admitted to the Department of Chemistry of Shaanxi Normal University. In the school band, he learned to play drums and began to perform in and out of the school. After graduation, he did not work as a chemistry teacher, nor did he engage in any matters related to knowledge or system, and walked and accompanied. In 1989, he came to Beijing. At that time, his younger brother Zhao Muyang was already a celebrity in the Beijing rock circle.
Known as the "Northwest Drum King." Since then he has entered the underground music world, working as a drummer, and earning money in the nightclubs in the South. Later, he suffered a major life bump, drifting away, gradually falling, and no longer mention that experience.
The boss said that in addition to a few days after graduation, he did not earn a penny from outside the music. But after 1998, in the past 10 years, he did not earn money by music. He lives in the underground music circle and relies on borrowing money and helping relatives and friends to make a living. "Later, I slowly became a person. There was only a pair of slippers, a toothbrush, and I lived in the countryside, and the farther I moved." It was around 2000, when a group of people lived with him in the countryside to the east of Beijing. In a few years, Ningxia people, Shandong people, and rock musicians in the field were there. When they said it, the place was called "the yard", like a commune, or a broken family. Everyone called him the boss, because he has 4 brothers and sisters in his family, he is the leader. But also because he is the oldest, the oldest, the poor but proud, and the style of the nobility. At that time, he was one of the few foreign musicians who lived in the countryside around Beijing. Everyone did not go to work, and no one needed their music.
In 2002, he was at the South Street of Sanlitun Bar Street. The lead singer of the Wild Boys Band opened the “River” Bar, which is the center of Beijing folk music. The circle of friends of the Boss is a young underground rock musician who has briefly stayed in a band like "Take melon"; his contemporaries have lived a stable life and are no longer in the same circle. The show is over, there are only a bunch of friends left in the bar, and the boss picks up the guitar and sings the song he sang. Everyone was sung by him, and some people cried. They are all popular songs of the 1980s. The content is quite simple. It is about love, the song of youth and the story full of human touch. The boss's guitar is also simple, has the taste of blues, has the taste of the northwest folk songs, but like his fingers on the strings, it is flexible and rough. He sang not the songs but his life. All the bitterness, all the good memories, his poverty and sorrow, his free soul.

** album confession**:
I should have been a chemistry teacher, and I was a drummer. For more than a decade, I have not been motivated, I have been doing nothing, I have been immersed in the narrow underground music kingdom, I am obsessed with the increasingly ridiculous and ridiculous cartoon situation, and I believe that in the face of a limited number of friends, I am righteous and categorically Advocating the parasite philosophy of "going to the extreme". I have never worked, and then borrowed money for a living.
Later, I slowly became a person. Only a pair of slippers, a toothbrush, lived in the countryside, and moved further and further.
Later, I laughed a bit ugly because I was getting no money. It is often forced to ask the family and struggle.
One day, I finally found out that I couldn’t move anymore. I drunk the wine and spit it the next day; the next morning, the wine didn't wake up, hey, let the tea spit.
That day, I found out that my face was particularly ugly and ugly. I finally know that I am too beautiful.
I love beautiful women all my life, I am infatuated with pretty women who dare not face and dare to marry, but I have never been beautiful, never beautiful.
I also know that in the freedom I pursue, I have not been free.
So, I finally fell down.
So, in the middle of the night, in the bright sunshine without money, in the smile or grief that only God or the ghost can see, I remembered the songs that I used to sing.
So today, I was forced to help, I corrected my thoughts, changed my identity, did not be a drummer, and reluctantly consciously sat here with some ridiculous dreams, ready to sing with the beautiful dreams of a young age.
